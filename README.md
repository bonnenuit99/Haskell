# Haskell

These ".hs" files are practices and assignments from my Programming Language Courses. We did some practices to write Haskell functions. I am not sure whether it is satisfied the prerequisites.

In class, we have learnt some haskell basic knowledge, control flow and scoping expressions, lists, higher-order functions and 
Algebraic Data Types.
